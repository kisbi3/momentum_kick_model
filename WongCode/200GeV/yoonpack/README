This is the program to run the parton distribution.

I normalize my distribution to 1, if we think of pi0,pi+,pi-, then I
should normalize to 3.  So, there is a porssible factor of 3 depending
on the convention of normalization.  In this program, I input the
normlization constant aNi, to allow for different identified particles
with different normalization constant

pardis.f is the fortran  program
pardis.x    executable file

pardis.in is the input cards, here I calcualte for pion

pardis.xn is the print output numbers, mostly a copy of the input 

pardis.07  output for  plotting  dN/dy after integrating pT

pardis.08  output for  dN/dyptdpt(y,pT) 

pardis.agr   is xmgrace plotting

pardis.eps   is eps file for the plots
