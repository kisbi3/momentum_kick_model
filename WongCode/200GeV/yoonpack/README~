This is the program to run the parton distribution.

I normalize my distribution to 1, if we think of pi0,pi+,pi-, then I
should normalize to 3.  So, there is a porssible factor of 3 depending
on the method of normalization.

pardis.f is the fortran  program


pardis.in is the input numbers
    I calcualte it for pion, kaons, protons, ... a few different cases

pardis.xn is the putput numbers, mostly a copy of the input 

pardis.07  output for printint out prupsoes
