#: description: Associated yield for the near side of the correlation function averaged over 2 $<|\Delta\eta|<$  4 for pp data at $\sqrt{s} =$ 7 $TeV$. The associated yield as a function of $p_{T}$ for events with $N^{offline}_{trk} \geq$ 110. The $p_{T}$ value for each $p_{T}$ bin is the average $p_{T}$ value.,,,,,,,
