#: description: Correlated yield obtained with the ZYAM procedure as a function of $|\Delta\Phi|$, averaged over 2 $<|\Delta\eta|<$ 4 in for 3.0 $<p_{T}<$ 4.0 $GeV/c$ and $N_{offline}^{trk}<$ 35 bins for pp data at $\sqrt =$ 13 $TeV$. The $p_{T}$ selection applies to both particles in the pair. Only statistical uncertainties are given. The subtracted ZYAM constant is given ($C_{ZYAM}$).
