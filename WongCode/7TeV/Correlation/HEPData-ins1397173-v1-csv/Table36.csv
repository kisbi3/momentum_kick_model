#: description: Associated yield for the near side of the correlation function averaged over 2 $<|\Delta\eta|<$  4 for pp data at $\sqrt{s} =$ 7 $TeV$. The associated yield as a function of $N_{trk}^{offline}$ for events with 1.0 $< p_{T} <$ 2.0 GeV/c. The $N_{trk}^{offline}$ value for each $N_{trk}^{offline}$ bin is the average $N_{trk}^{offline}$ value.
